    Hello! My name is Ellie Yin, and I'm a senior in Kirkland House studying CS with a secondary in Sociology! I'm originally from the East Bay Area in California, and I love traveling to new places, getting new movie + book recommendations (please send them my way), and playing tennis as well as snowboarding. It's been a dream of mine to learn how to be a generalist and make cool things with my hands, so I'm super excited to finally be able to take this class and learn all about building this semester! :D
    <br></br>
    Fun fact: this photo was taken at the Mirror Room in the Leonardo da Vinci Machines Exhibition in Rome! Very fitting.
